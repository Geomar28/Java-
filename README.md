# Assignment Introduction
Some big systems, such as the Google search engine, make use of files to manipulate data, because traditional RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) cannot handle the amount of requests generated by these systems.

Files are also used by applications to store information about its last state (E.g. which files a text editor was editing when it was closed), to store information about user’s preference (E.g. cookies of a web browser), and as a way to exchange data from one application to another (E.g. A bank and a company exchange data of invoices).

In computer programming, CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) (Sometimes called SCRUD with an “S” for Search) are the basic operations that are performed over a set of data. For example, in a spreadsheet of students, a new student could be added (Create), or the information of a specific student could be displayed (Read), or the information could be modified (Update), or the student could be removed from the list (Delete).
